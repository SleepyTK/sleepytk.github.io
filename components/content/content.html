    Welcome to my website! Here, I plan to improve and showcase my CSS skills by creating a variety of designs for you to explore and use if you'd like. 
    I'll be working on smaller elements, such as buttons, cards, and animations, as well as larger projects like full webpagesand CSS guides with tips and tricks.
