    Welcome to my website! Here, I plan to improve and showcase my CSS skills by creating a variety of designs for you to explore and use if you'd like. 
    I'll be working on smaller elements, such as buttons, cards, and animations, as well as larger projects like full webpagesand CSS guides with tips and tricks.

    I am currently working on adding categories to the website. So far, I have added button examples and card examples. 
    I plan to add eight more categories, which you can explore, and I hope to continually improve the website's design.
